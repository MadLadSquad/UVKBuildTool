# UVKBuildTool
The BuildTool for the UntitledVulkanGameEngine 
## Getting started
On Windows you are going to need git and cmake, on Linux you are going to need git, cmake and gcc. After you have all of the programs needed you need to clone and compile the build tool. First clone the project by typing `git clone https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UVKBuildTool.git --recursive`. This will download the build tool and all of it's dependencies. Then use cmake to build the project and you are done!
## Use guide
To run the program do not run it through your IDE because you are not going to get a result! What you need to do is build the program. You should also use the standard UntitledVulkanGameEngine layout that should look like this ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/747210943188041861/787027560546304020/unknown.png)

Where your BuildTool root location should look like this with the build folder only one directory deep. Note do not move the executable from the BuildFolder or you can break file generation.
