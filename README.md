# UVKBuildTool
The BuildTool for the UntitledVulkanGameEngine 
## Getting started
On Windows you are going to need git and cmake, on Linux you are going to need git, cmake and gcc. After you have all of the programs needed you need to clone and compile the build tool. First clone the project by typing `git clone https://github.com/MadLadSquad/UVKBuildTool.git --recursive`. This will download the build tool and all of it's dependencies. Then use cmake to build the project and you are done!
